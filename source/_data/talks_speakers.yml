        <br /> <br /> We’ll introduce the concept of Signals in Angular, discussing their role in creating more reactive and maintainable applications. 
        <br /<br />Key focus areas include the integration of Signals for efficient data flow and state changes, and the reduction in complexity this brings to Angular architecture. Through practical examples, we will illustrate how Signals can be leveraged in various architectural patterns to facilitate better performance and developer productivity. 
        <br /<br />
        Ideal for Angular developers and architects, this presentation aims to equip participants with the knowledge to harness Signals in optimizing their application architecture for better scalability and maintainability."

        talk_title: "Smart Nano Stores, or how to make state management in Angular simpler"
        talk_description: "It's hard to name popular state management libraries for Angular that are totally ideal. They are often cumbersome, which makes the bundle heavier, many of them require a boilerplate and overload components with complex logic. Moreover, sometimes we have to choose a state manager, sacrificing performance, maintainability, or readability.

        <br /><br />But what if the state management process could get rid of these flaws and become much simpler? In this talk, I want to show how this can be made possible with Nano Stores – a teeny (from 334 bytes) state manager based on the idea of smart atomic stores. It has zero dependencies, its own ecosystem, and is supported in all popular frameworks including Angular.

        <br /><br />With illustrative examples, I want to demonstrate that state management using tiny atomic tree-shakable stores can be much more minimalistic, faster, and more convenient than we are used to seeing it."
