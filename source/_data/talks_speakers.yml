        talk_title: "Smart Nano Stores, or how to make state management in Angular simpler"
        talk_description: "It's hard to name popular state management libraries for Angular that are totally ideal. They are often cumbersome, which makes the bundle heavier, many of them require a boilerplate and overload components with complex logic. Moreover, sometimes we have to choose a state manager, sacrificing performance, maintainability, or readability.

        <br /><br />But what if the state management process could get rid of these flaws and become much simpler? In this talk, I want to show how this can be made possible with Nano Stores – a teeny (from 334 bytes) state manager based on the idea of smart atomic stores. It has zero dependencies, its own ecosystem, and is supported in all popular frameworks including Angular.

        <br /><br />With illustrative examples, I want to demonstrate that state management using tiny atomic tree-shakable stores can be much more minimalistic, faster, and more convenient than we are used to seeing it."

        Take it up a notch by turning it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). With Angular's help, upgrading your app to a PWA and setting up the necessary service worker is easy. 
        <br />The service worker keeps your app accessible even offline, storing all important data. Plus, your PWA can act like a desktop or mobile app, giving users a native app feel. 
        <br /> <br />Join me as we explore Angular PWAs, showing you how to set up your app and make it look good on any device."
