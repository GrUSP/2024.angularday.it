        talk_description: "Ready to boost your Angular App? <br />
        Take it up a notch by turning it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). With Angular's help, upgrading your app to a PWA and setting up the necessary service worker is easy. 
        <br />The service worker keeps your app accessible even offline, storing all important data. Plus, your PWA can act like a desktop or mobile app, giving users a native app feel. Join us as we explore Angular PWAs, showing you how to set up your app and make it look good on any device."
